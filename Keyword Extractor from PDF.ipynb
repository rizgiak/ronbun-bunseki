In this work,\\nwe present a novel non-anthropomorphic robot grasper with\\nthe ability to manipulate objects by means of active surfaces at\\nthe ﬁngertips. Active surfaces are achieved by spherical rolling\\nﬁngertips with two degrees of freedom (DoF) – a pivoting\\nmotion for surface reorientation – and a continuous rolling\\nmotion for moving the object. A further DoF is in the base\\nof each ﬁnger, allowing the ﬁngers to grasp objects over a\\nrange of size and shapes. Instantaneous kinematics was derived\\nand objects were successfully manipulated both with a custom\\nhandcrafted control scheme as well as one learned through\\nimitation learning,\\nin simulation and experimentally on the\\nhardware.\\n\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIn an effort to bring robots from the laboratory into real\\nworld environments, researchers have endeavored to develop\\nincreasingly dexterous robots that can interact deftly with\\nobjects. In order for such robots to take on a wide range\\nof everyday tasks, they need to be capable of sophisticated\\nobject manipulation. Many vital higher-level tasks will rely\\non a robot’s capability to perform in-hand manipulation by\\nreorienting objects while maintaining the grasp. Out of all\\nthe grasping and manipulation tasks, in-hand manipulation\\nis among the ones that require the most dexterity.\\n\\nA background of in-hand manipulation literature is pre-\\nsented in [1] and a more extensive review of robot hands and\\ngraspers is given in [2]. Common approaches to designing\\nrobotic grippers that can perform in-hand manipulation are:\\nanthropomorphic hands which take advantage of intrinsic\\nhuman dexterity, but due to the high number of degrees\\nof freedom are complex and expensive [3] [4] [5]; under-\\nactuated hands which passively conform to objects, achieving\\ngood grasp stability, but at the cost of the controllability\\nneeded to perform many in-hand manipulation tasks [6] [7]\\n[8] [9]; grippers with active surfaces (such as conveyors)\\nwhich allow for the object to be manipulated without chang-\\ning grasp pose, but with a ﬁxed conveyor orientation limiting\\npossible motions [10] [11] [12].\\n\\nWe developed a novel grasper design using articulated, ac-\\ntively driven spherical rollers located at the ﬁngertips, shown\\nin Fig. 1. By incorporating continuous rotating mechanisms,\\n\\n*This work has been funded, in part, by the Stanford Interdisciplinary\\nGraduate Fellowship. Detailed implementations can be found at: https://\\nccrma.stanford.edu/˜shenliy/roller_grasper_v2.html\\n\\n1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University\\n2Stanford Artiﬁcial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), Stanford University\\n{shenliy, lins2, clyako, agruebe2}@stanford.edu,\\n\\njks@cs.stanford.edu\\n\\nFig. 1. The Roller Grasper V2 prototype mounted on a UR-5 robot arm.\\nThree ﬁngers, each with three degrees of freedom, can grasp and reorient\\nan object using rolling contact with the rubber coated rollers\\n\\nit is possible to create graspers that are highly capable but\\nrelatively simple by design. The active surface achieved by\\nrolling and reorientation of the spherical rollers allow the\\ngrasper to perform in-hand manipulation without the need\\nfor ﬁnger gaiting. Rolling contact on the object can be\\nviewed as a motion that continuously breaks contact with\\nthe object while simultaneously re-establishing contact at\\nadjacent locations. The ability to reorient an object to any\\npose also lessens the need to use externally actuated degrees\\nof freedom (e.g. actuation of the robotic arm and wrist)\\nwhich simpliﬁes the control scheme. More importantly, the\\nspherical design of the ﬁnger tips allows for stable grasps\\nindependent from the roller orientations, eliminating the need\\nto analyze grasping modes for different combinations of\\nroller orientations.\\n\\nLearning robust policies for in-hand manipulation has been\\na long-standing challenge in robotics due to the complex-\\nity of modelling the object and grasper contacts and the\\ndifﬁculty of controlling ﬁnger motion in long and compli-\\ncated manipulation sequences. Deep Reinforcement Learning\\n(DRL) has been used to learn dexterous manipulation [13]\\n[14]. However, learning to hold the object ﬁrmly and stably\\nwhile transforming the object with deep reinforcement learn-\\ning requires many more training episodes and a carefully\\ndesigned reward function. To overcome these issues, we used\\nan imitation learning based approach to learn a control policy\\nin order to arbitrarily transform an object while holding it.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n

Sci., 2020, 13, 24 Conjugated polymers for visible-light-driven photocatalysis Chunhui Dai and Bin Liu * Conjugated polymers have recently been under active investigation as promising alternatives to traditional inorganic semiconductors for photocatalysis. This is due to their unique advantages of low cost, high chemical stability, and molecularly tunable optoelectronic properties. This critical review summarizes the recent advancements in p-conjugated polymers for visible-light-driven photocatalytic applications including water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic transformation and degradation of organic dyes. Special emphasis is placed on how the changes in the polymer structure could influence their physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activities. This structure–activity relationship analysis should guide rational molecular design of conjugated polymers for improved photocatalytic activity. Broader context The exploitation of eﬃcient photocatalysts to directly convert the radiant sunlight into chemical energy is of great importance to address the current energy and environmental challenges. Conjugated polymers (CPs) consisting of photoactive p-systems represent an attractive platform for solar energy utilization. They have been intensively studied for a variety of photocatalytic applications and many exciting performances were reported through facile molecular design. A comprehensive review is thus timely to summarize the progress of the field. This review article systematically presents the recent advances in conjugated polymers for visible-light-driven photocatalysis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic transformation and degradation of organic dyes. The synthesis and design principles of conjugated polymers in these photocatalytic applications are illustrated, with an emphasis on the correlation between polymer structures and their photocatalytic activities. We expect that the systematic discussion in this review will not only provide a general overview of the field, but also promote the development of conjugated polymers with fascinating properties for photocatalysis. 1.

In this research, a Robotino® from Festo Company was used to reach a predeﬁned target in different scenarios, autonomously, in a static and dynamic environment. A Type-2 fuzzy logic controller was used to guide and help Robotino® reach its predeﬁned destination safely. The Robotino® collects data from the environment. The rules of the Type-2 fuzzy logic controller were built from human experience. They controlled the Robotino® movement, guiding it toward its goal by controlling its linear and angular velocities, preventing it from colliding obstacles at the same time, as well. The Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) algorithm was implemented. Real-time and simulation experimental results showed the capability and effectiveness of the proposed controller, especially in dealing with uncertainty problems.

Introduction  Nowadays, robots are an inseparable part of our life. Robots with movement ability impose themselves through many applications, including medical facilities, hospitality, entertainment, package delivery, space, and military. Recently, mobile robots have been a controlling contributor to human development and one of the fastest growth ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research. They have displayed their abilities in helping and substituting humans in many applications with high efﬁciency [1].  The obstacle avoidance is an important feature in mobile robots that enables them to reach their destination point collision free. This necessitates providing them with a decisionmaking capability for planning their path autonomously and reacting to the hazards that may hinder their movements. However, this is no longer easily achieved by using classical control approaches without prior information available about the environment and using intelligent control [1]. Furthermore, some of the intelligent control methods cannot handle the high level of uncertainties of sensors, actuators, and environment [2].  For achieving autonomous obstacle avoidance, numerous control strategies have been developed, among which is the Type-2 fuzzy logic control. Fuzzy logic control is considered the most vastly used technique for designing controllers that manage suitable performance in many real-world applications [3]. For example, it was used to design a controller capable of introducing a safe Robotino® and tracking its predeﬁned target, as in Ref. [4]. A fuzzy logic controller with 153 fuzzy rules was utilized for controlling the Robotino® path-tracking issue, while another fuzzy logic controller with 27 fuzzy rules was applied for the Robotino® obstacle-avoidance feature, using the Sugeno fuzzy algorithm. Many real-time experiments reﬂected good abilities of the proposed controllers.

Precise Twisting and Positioning by a Novel Dexterous Robotic Gripper for Industrial High-Speed Assembly Fei Chen, Member, IEEE, Ferdinando Cannella, Member, IEEE, Carlo Canali, Traveler Hauptman, Giuseppe Soﬁa, and Darwin Caldwell, Fellow, IEEE Abstract— In electronic manufacturing system, the design of the robotic hand with sufﬁcient dexterity and conﬁguration is important for the successful accomplishment of the assembly task. Due to the growing demand from high-mix manufacturing industry, it is difﬁcult for the traditional robot to grasp a large number of assembly parts or tools having cylinder shapes with correct postures. In this research, a novel jaw like gripper with human-sized anthropomorphic features is designed for in-hand precise positioning and twisting online. It retains the simplicity feature of traditional industrial grippers and dexterity features of dexterous grippers. It can apply a constant gripping force on assembly parts and performs reliable twisting movement within limited time to meet the industrial requirements. Manipulating several cylindrical assembly parts by robot, as an experimental case in this paper, is studied to evaluate its performance. The effectiveness of proposed gripper design and mechanical analysis is proved by the simulation and experimental results. I. INTRODUCTION During the past tens of year, the development in manufacturing industry has been divided into three main streams: Massive Production, Medium Production and Small production. Small production, usually fully using robots, cannot keep in step with the growing social demanding for HighMix, Low-Volume manufacturing. For the manufacturing fully with human workers, the labor cost is also increasing rapidly. When addressing this problem, it is important to build more ﬂexible systems to improve the dexterity and reconﬁgurability of current manufacturing system by considering combining and coordinating the above two respects, considering their trade-off and improving the overall assembly effectiveness and efﬁciency [1]. From our research, if we can provide the robot with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility in reconﬁguration, it can help the factory boosting the product quality and meanwhile reducing the cost [2]. Currently in robotic assembly cell for ﬂexible manufacturing, there still remain many unsolved issues for robots. One is that the robot cannot work efﬁciently in dealing with assembly parts with complicated shapes. They often rely on external sensor systems to help with the assembly work [3]. On the other side, human workers are skilled in performing complicated tasks using their hands. In this case, it is essential that the conventional robotic manipulator is able to perform complicated manipulation like human worker Fei Chen, Ferdinando Cannella, Carlo Canali, Traveler Hauptman, Giuseppe Soﬁa, Darwin Caldwell are within the Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy, 16163, E-mail: {fei.chen, ferdinando.cannella, carlo.canali, traveler.hauptman, giuseppe.soﬁa, darwin.caldwell}@iit.it. Fig. 1. Assembly scenario in this research under AUTORECON project [4]. The objective of AUTORECON project is to design a manufacturing system with reconﬁgurable robotic manipulator under the well controlled information ﬂow. To design several reconﬁgurable robotic hands suitable for industrial implementation is one of its tasks. does. During the past years of development in robotic manipulators, nevertheless, the basic appearance of the manipulator has seldom changed, and it is also difﬁcult on the other hand to modify the basic architecture of robots. Therefore, people tend to improve the capacity of robots by designing various functional end-effectors (hands) for robots. In order to meet industrial application requirements, the robotic hands must be inexpensive, compact, low weight and robust. It also must be capable of performing simple grasping and manipulation tasks, such as precision manipulation, inhand grasp transitions, and sufﬁciently general to manipulate different objects and tools. Up to present, most robotic hands in both industrial and academic worlds are either few actuators powered jaws, or simpliﬁed human hand shape liked multi-ﬁngered hands for certain grasping patterns. Lots of researchers have already paid much attention to develop such functional robotic end-effectors in the past 25 years. A robotic gripper could be of two ﬁngers, like a jaw [3] with two ﬁngers in our previous research, three ﬁngers [5] or four ﬁngers [6] or even more, the same with human’s hand [7]. Parallel manipulator [8] has been already successfully implemented in industry. They can perform and demonstrate pick and place operations in really fast speed with high reliability [9]. Meanwhile, it is much cheaper and simpler than serial manipulators. It is widely adopted in high speed, high-accuracy positioning within only limited workspace, such as food packing and electronic parts placing.

However, learning to hold the object ﬁrmly and stably\nwhile transforming the object with deep reinforcement learn-\ning requires many more training episodes and a carefully\ndesigned reward function.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used to learn dexterous manipulation [13] [14]. However, learning to hold the object ﬁrmly and stably while transforming the object with deep reinforcement learning requires many more training episodes and a carefully designed reward function. To overcome these issues, we used an imitation learning based approach to learn a control policy in order to arbitrarily transform an object while holding it.

This is due to their unique advantages of low cost, high chemical stability, and molecularly tunable optoelectronic properties. This critical review summarizes the recent advancements in p-conjugated polymers for visible-light-driven photocatalytic applications including water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic transformation and degradation of organic dyes. Special emphasis is placed on how the changes in the polymer structure could influence their physicochemical properties  and photocatalytic activities. This structure–activity relationship analysis should guide rational molecular  rsc.li/ees  design of conjugated polymers for improved photocatalytic activity.  Broader context The exploitation of eﬃcient photocatalysts to directly convert the radiant sunlight into chemical energy is of great importance to address the current energy and environmental challenges. Conjugated polymers (CPs) consisting of photoactive p-systems represent an attractive platform for solar energy utilization. They have been intensively studied for a variety of photocatalytic applications and many exciting performances were reported through facile molecular design. A comprehensive review is thus timely to summarize the progress of the field. This review article systematically presents the recent advances in conjugated polymers for visible-light-driven photocatalysis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, organic transformation and degradation of organic dyes. The synthesis and design principles of conjugated polymers in these photocatalytic applications are illustrated, with an emphasis on the correlation between polymer structures and their photocatalytic activities. We expect that the systematic discussion in this review will not only provide a general overview of the field, but also promote the development of conjugated polymers with fascinating properties for photocatalysis.

The main idea is not to replace the human farmer, but to augment his/her capabilities by deploying mobile robots as assistants in ﬁeld operations. The scheme is based on a leader–follower approach. The manned tractor is used as a leader, which will be taken as a reference point for a follower. The follower then takes the position of the leader as a target, and follows it in an autonomous manner. This will allow the farmer to multiply the working width by the number of mobile robots deployed during ﬁeld operations. In this paper, we present a detailed description of the system, the theoretical aspect that allows the robot to autonomously follow the tractor, in addition to the different experimental steps that allowed us to test the system in the ﬁeld to assess the robustness of the proposed scheme.

Introduction  The agricultural sector is facing an ever-growing pressure to produce enough food for an increasing population, while maintaining a low level of environmental impact. The combination of both goals necessitates the inclusion of the latest advances in remotesensing techniques to collect the data as well as the latest developments in agricultural machinery to mitigate the problems that the world is facing at present regarding having a sufﬁcient food supply for everyone. Adding to this, the aging population in the agricultural sector is another factor that increases the need to look for newer alternatives to the conventional practices.  Robotics and artiﬁcial intelligent (AI) systems have contributed to the revolution of industrial processes for decades; however, the agricultural sector is still lagging behind, although it is a vital sector that is the foundation of human beings’ existence. The latest advances in robotics and AI should be gradually included, where these tools ﬁrst assist the farmers in their daily tasks, before completely replacing them in a farmer-free scenario. The main purpose of this is to provide a solution that can be adopted in the near future, in which the farmer is still in touch with the daily activities of the ﬁeld operations, and to work within the frame of the current legislation regarding the autonomous operations of robotic platforms, namely, the necessity of having a human supervisor that can take back control of the autonomous robot at all times.  Building upon the idea of using robots to assist farmers in their daily tasks, the cooperative nature of these type of systems needs to be addressed. Inspired mainly from nature (e.g., ants [1]), cooperation in robotic systems has attracted the attention of the mobile robotic research community in recent years, due to the great advantages that can be obtained by deploying multiple robots, where each robot can overcome the limitations of the other robots (perception, calculation abilities, payload, etc). Thus, the efﬁciency of the mission is increased without the need to have a single, complete, complex mobile robot.  Citation: Harik, E.H.C.

The main idea is not to replace the human farmer, but to augment his/her capabilities by deploying mobile robots as assistants in ﬁeld operations. The scheme is based on a leader–follower approach. The manned tractor is used as a leader, which will be taken as a reference point for a follower. The follower then takes the position of the leader as a target, and follows it in an autonomous manner. This will allow the farmer to multiply the working width by the number of mobile robots deployed during ﬁeld operations. In this paper, we present a detailed description of the system, the theoretical aspect that allows the robot to autonomously follow the tractor, in addition to the different experimental steps that allowed us to test the system in the ﬁeld to assess the robustness of the proposed scheme.  Keywords: precision agriculture; agricultural robots; leader–follower navigation; multi-vehicle operations  1. Introduction  The agricultural sector is facing an ever-growing pressure to produce enough food for an increasing population, while maintaining a low level of environmental impact. The combination of both goals necessitates the inclusion of the latest advances in remotesensing techniques to collect the data as well as the latest developments in agricultural machinery to mitigate the problems that the world is facing at present regarding having a sufﬁcient food supply for everyone. Adding to this, the aging population in the agricultural sector is another factor that increases the need to look for newer alternatives to the conventional practices.  Robotics and artiﬁcial intelligent (AI) systems have contributed to the revolution of industrial processes for decades; however, the agricultural sector is still lagging behind, although it is a vital sector that is the foundation of human beings’ existence. The latest advances in robotics and AI should be gradually included, where these tools ﬁrst assist the farmers in their daily tasks, before completely replacing them in a farmer-free scenario. The main purpose of this is to provide a solution that can be adopted in the near future, in which the farmer is still in touch with the daily activities of the ﬁeld operations, and to work within the frame of the current legislation regarding the autonomous operations of robotic platforms, namely, the necessity of having a human supervisor that can take back control of the autonomous robot at all times.  Building upon the idea of using robots to assist farmers in their daily tasks, the cooperative nature of these type of systems needs to be addressed. Inspired mainly from nature (e.g., ants [1]), cooperation in robotic systems has attracted the attention of the mobile robotic research community in recent years, due to the great advantages that can be obtained by deploying multiple robots, where each robot can overcome the limitations of the other robots (perception, calculation abilities, payload, etc). Thus, the efﬁciency of the mission is increased without the need to have a single, complete, complex mobile robot.  Citation: Harik, E.H.C.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn an effort to bring robots from the laboratory into real\nworld environments, researchers have endeavored to develop\nincreasingly dexterous robots that can interact deftly with\nobjects. In order for such robots to take on a wide range\nof everyday tasks, they need to be capable of sophisticated\nobject manipulation. Many vital higher-level tasks will rely\non a robot’s capability to perform in-hand manipulation by\nreorienting objects while maintaining the grasp. Out of all\nthe grasping and manipulation tasks, in-hand manipulation\nis among the ones that require the most dexterity.\n\nA background of in-hand manipulation literature is pre-\nsented in [1] and a more extensive review of robot hands and\ngraspers is given in [2]. Common approaches to designing\nrobotic grippers that can perform in-hand manipulation are:\nanthropomorphic hands which take advantage of intrinsic\nhuman dexterity, but due to the high number of degrees\nof freedom are complex and expensive [3] [4] [5]; under-\nactuated hands which passively conform to objects, achieving\ngood grasp stability, but at the cost of the controllability\nneeded to perform many in-hand manipulation tasks [6] [7]\n[8] [9]; grippers with active surfaces (such as conveyors)\nwhich allow for the object to be manipulated without chang-\ning grasp pose, but with a ﬁxed conveyor orientation limiting\npossible motions [10] [11] [12].\n\nWe developed a novel grasper design using articulated, ac-\ntively driven spherical rollers located at the ﬁngertips, shown\nin Fig. 1. By incorporating continuous rotating mechanisms,\n\n*This work has been funded, in part, by the Stanford Interdisciplinary\nGraduate Fellowship.

The Roller Grasper V2 prototype mounted on a UR-5 robot arm.\nThree ﬁngers, each with three degrees of freedom, can grasp and reorient\nan object using rolling contact with the rubber coated rollers\n\nit is possible to create graspers that are highly capable but\nrelatively simple by design. The active surface achieved by\nrolling and reorientation of the spherical rollers allow the\ngrasper to perform in-hand manipulation without the need\nfor ﬁnger gaiting. Rolling contact on the object can be\nviewed as a motion that continuously breaks contact with\nthe object while simultaneously re-establishing contact at\nadjacent locations. The ability to reorient an object to any\npose also lessens the need to use externally actuated degrees\nof freedom (e.g. actuation of the robotic arm and wrist)\nwhich simpliﬁes the control scheme. More importantly, the\nspherical design of the ﬁnger tips allows for stable grasps\nindependent from the roller orientations, eliminating the need\nto analyze grasping modes for different combinations of\nroller orientations.\n\nLearning robust policies for in-hand manipulation has been\na long-standing challenge in robotics due to the complex-\nity of modelling the object and grasper contacts and the\ndifﬁculty of controlling ﬁnger motion in long and compli-\ncated manipulation sequences. Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) has been used to learn dexterous manipulation [13]\n[14]. However, learning to hold the object ﬁrmly and stably\nwhile transforming the object with deep reinforcement learn-\ning requires many more training episodes and a carefully\ndesigned reward function.

Precise Twisting and Positioning by a Novel Dexterous Robotic Gripper for Industrial High-Speed Assembly Fei Chen, Member, IEEE, Ferdinando Cannella, Member, IEEE, Carlo Canali, Traveler Hauptman, Giuseppe Soﬁa, and Darwin Caldwell, Fellow, IEEE Abstract— In electronic manufacturing system, the design of the robotic hand with sufﬁcient dexterity and conﬁguration is important for the successful accomplishment of the assembly task. Due to the growing demand from high-mix manufacturing industry, it is difﬁcult for the traditional robot to grasp a large number of assembly parts or tools having cylinder shapes with correct postures. In this research, a novel jaw like gripper with human-sized anthropomorphic features is designed for in-hand precise positioning and twisting online. It retains the simplicity feature of traditional industrial grippers and dexterity features of dexterous grippers. It can apply a constant gripping force on assembly parts and performs reliable twisting movement within limited time to meet the industrial requirements. Manipulating several cylindrical assembly parts by robot, as an experimental case in this paper, is studied to evaluate its performance. The effectiveness of proposed gripper design and mechanical analysis is proved by the simulation and experimental results. I. INTRODUCTION During the past tens of year, the development in manufacturing industry has been divided into three main streams: Massive Production, Medium Production and Small production. Small production, usually fully using robots, cannot keep in step with the growing social demanding for HighMix, Low-Volume manufacturing. For the manufacturing fully with human workers, the labor cost is also increasing rapidly. When addressing this problem, it is important to build more ﬂexible systems to improve the dexterity and reconﬁgurability of current manufacturing system by considering combining and coordinating the above two respects, considering their trade-off and improving the overall assembly effectiveness and efﬁciency [1]. From our research, if we can provide the robot with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility in reconﬁguration, it can help the factory boosting the product quality and meanwhile reducing the cost [2]. Currently in robotic assembly cell for ﬂexible manufacturing, there still remain many unsolved issues for robots. One is that the robot cannot work efﬁciently in dealing with assembly parts with complicated shapes. They often rely on external sensor systems to help with the assembly work [3]. On the other side, human workers are skilled in performing complicated tasks using their hands. In this case, it is essential that the conventional robotic manipulator is able to perform complicated manipulation like human worker Fei Chen, Ferdinando Cannella, Carlo Canali, Traveler Hauptman, Giuseppe Soﬁa, Darwin Caldwell are within the Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy, 16163, E-mail: {fei.chen, ferdinando.cannella, carlo.canali, traveler.hauptman, giuseppe.soﬁa, darwin.caldwell}@iit.it. Fig. 1. Assembly scenario in this research under AUTORECON project [4]. The objective of AUTORECON project is to design a manufacturing system with reconﬁgurable robotic manipulator under the well controlled information ﬂow. To design several reconﬁgurable robotic hands suitable for industrial implementation is one of its tasks. does. During the past years of development in robotic manipulators, nevertheless, the basic appearance of the manipulator has seldom changed, and it is also difﬁcult on the other hand to modify the basic architecture of robots. Therefore, people tend to improve the capacity of robots by designing various functional end-effectors (hands) for robots. In order to meet industrial application requirements, the robotic hands must be inexpensive, compact, low weight and robust. It also must be capable of performing simple grasping and manipulation tasks, such as precision manipulation, inhand grasp transitions, and sufﬁciently general to manipulate different objects and tools. Up to present, most robotic hands in both industrial and academic worlds are either few actuators powered jaws, or simpliﬁed human hand shape liked multi-ﬁngered hands for certain grasping patterns. Lots of researchers have already paid much attention to develop such functional robotic end-effectors in the past 25 years. A robotic gripper could be of two ﬁngers, like a jaw [3] with two ﬁngers in our previous research, three ﬁngers [5] or four ﬁngers [6] or even more, the same with human’s hand [7]. Parallel manipulator [8] has been already successfully implemented in industry. They can perform and demonstrate pick and place operations in really fast speed with high reliability [9]. Meanwhile, it is much cheaper and simpler than serial manipulators.

In this work, we present a novel non-anthropomorphic robot grasper with the ability to manipulate objects by means of active surfaces at the ﬁngertips. Active surfaces are achieved by spherical rolling ﬁngertips with two degrees of freedom (DoF) – a pivoting motion for surface reorientation – and a continuous rolling motion for moving the object. A further DoF is in the base of each ﬁnger, allowing the ﬁngers to grasp objects over a range of size and shapes. Instantaneous kinematics was derived and objects were successfully manipulated both with a custom handcrafted control scheme as well as one learned through imitation learning, in simulation and experimentally on the hardware. I. INTRODUCTION In an effort to bring robots from the laboratory into real world environments, researchers have endeavored to develop increasingly dexterous robots that can interact deftly with objects. In order for such robots to take on a wide range of everyday tasks, they need to be capable of sophisticated object manipulation. Many vital higher-level tasks will rely on a robot’s capability to perform in-hand manipulation by reorienting objects while maintaining the grasp. Out of all the grasping and manipulation tasks, in-hand manipulation is among the ones that require the most dexterity. A background of in-hand manipulation literature is presented in [1] and a more extensive review of robot hands and graspers is given in [2]. Common approaches to designing robotic grippers that can perform in-hand manipulation are: anthropomorphic hands which take advantage of intrinsic human dexterity, but due to the high number of degrees of freedom are complex and expensive [3] [4] [5]; underactuated hands which passively conform to objects, achieving good grasp stability, but at the cost of the controllability needed to perform many in-hand manipulation tasks [6] [7] [8] [9]; grippers with active surfaces (such as conveyors) which allow for the object to be manipulated without changing grasp pose, but with a ﬁxed conveyor orientation limiting possible motions [10] [11] [12]. We developed a novel grasper design using articulated, actively driven spherical rollers located at the ﬁngertips, shown in Fig. 1.

The active surface achieved by rolling and reorientation of the spherical rollers allow the grasper to perform in-hand manipulation without the need for ﬁnger gaiting. Rolling contact on the object can be viewed as a motion that continuously breaks contact with the object while simultaneously re-establishing contact at adjacent locations. The ability to reorient an object to any pose also lessens the need to use externally actuated degrees of freedom (e.g. actuation of the robotic arm and wrist) which simpliﬁes the control scheme. More importantly, the spherical design of the ﬁnger tips allows for stable grasps independent from the roller orientations, eliminating the need to analyze grasping modes for different combinations of roller orientations. Learning robust policies for in-hand manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in robotics due to the complexity of modelling the object and grasper contacts and the difﬁculty of controlling ﬁnger motion in long and complicated manipulation sequences. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used to learn dexterous manipulation [13] [14]. However, learning to hold the object ﬁrmly and stably while transforming the object with deep reinforcement learning requires many more training episodes and a carefully designed reward function. To overcome these issues, we used an imitation learning based approach to learn a control policy in order to arbitrarily transform an object while holding it.

A Type-2 fuzzy logic controller was used to guide and help Robotino® reach its predeﬁned destination safely. The Robotino® collects data from the environment. The rules of the Type-2 fuzzy logic controller were built from human experience. They controlled the Robotino® movement, guiding it toward its goal by controlling its linear and angular velocities, preventing it from colliding obstacles at the same time, as well. The Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) algorithm was implemented. Real-time and simulation experimental results showed the capability and effectiveness of the proposed controller, especially in dealing with uncertainty problems.

Introduction  Nowadays, robots are an inseparable part of our life. Robots with movement ability impose themselves through many applications, including medical facilities, hospitality, entertainment, package delivery, space, and military. Recently, mobile robots have been a controlling contributor to human development and one of the fastest growth ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research. They have displayed their abilities in helping and substituting humans in many applications with high efﬁciency [1].  The obstacle avoidance is an important feature in mobile robots that enables them to reach their destination point collision free. This necessitates providing them with a decisionmaking capability for planning their path autonomously and reacting to the hazards that may hinder their movements. However, this is no longer easily achieved by using classical control approaches without prior information available about the environment and using intelligent control [1]. Furthermore, some of the intelligent control methods cannot handle the high level of uncertainties of sensors, actuators, and environment [2].  For achieving autonomous obstacle avoidance, numerous control strategies have been developed, among which is the Type-2 fuzzy logic control. Fuzzy logic control is considered the most vastly used technique for designing controllers that manage suitable performance in many real-world applications [3]. For example, it was used to design a controller capable of introducing a safe Robotino® and tracking its predeﬁned target, as in Ref. [4]. A fuzzy logic controller with 153 fuzzy rules was utilized for controlling the Robotino® path-tracking issue, while another fuzzy logic controller with 27 fuzzy rules was applied for the Robotino® obstacle-avoidance feature, using the Sugeno fuzzy algorithm. Many real-time experiments reﬂected good abilities of the proposed controllers. Moreover, an autonomous mobile robot was designed and implemented by using a fuzzy logic controller,  Robotics 2022, 11, 130. https://doi.org/10.3390/robotics11060130  https://www.mdpi.com/journal/robotics  robotics\f"}},"de9b5f6f7d3c4473a1862cd625df223e":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/output","model_module_version":"1.0.0","model_name":"OutputModel","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/output","_model_module_version":"1.0.0","_model_name":"OutputModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/output","_view_module_version":"1.0.0","_view_name":"OutputView","layout":"IPY_MODEL_76edfa22133b4d76bfb7c067a207e439","msg_id":"","outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"141a23bbb603486aa86350566af76ed3","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":"HTML(value='24 | Energy Environ.
