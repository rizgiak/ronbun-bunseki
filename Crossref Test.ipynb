Relevant problems include movement recognition, pose estimation, pose tracking, body correspondence, coordinate transformation from external to egocentric space, matching of observed against previously learned movement, resolution of redundant degrees\\u2013of\\u2013freedom that are unconstrained by the observation, suitable movement representations for imitation, modularization of motor control, etc. All of these topics by themselves are active research problems in computational and neurobiological sciences, such that their combination into a complete imitation system remains a daunting undertaking\\u2014indeed, one could argue that we need to understand the complete perception\\u2013action loop. As a strategy to untangle the complexity of imitation, this paper will examine imitation purely from a computational point of view, i.e. we will review statistical and mathematical approaches that have been suggested for tackling parts of the imitation problem, and discuss their merits, disadvantages and underlying principles. Given the focus on action recognition of other contributions in this special issue, this paper will primarily emphasize the motor side of imitation, assuming that a perceptual system has already identified important features of a demonstrated movement and created their corresponding spatial information. Based on the formalization of motor control in terms of control policies and their associated performance criteria, useful taxonomies of imitation learning can be generated that clarify different approaches and future research directions.</jats:p>\", \"DOI\": \"10.1098/rstb.2002.1258\", \"type\": \"journal-article\", \"created\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003, 3, 5]], \"date-time\": \"2003-03-05T01:52:21Z\", \"timestamp\": 1046829141000}, \"page\": \"537-547\", \"source\": \"Crossref\", \"is-referenced-by-count\": 370, \"title\": [\"Computational approaches to motor learning by imitation\"], \"prefix\": \"10.1098\", \"volume\": \"358\", \"author\": [{\"given\": \"Stefan\", \"family\": \"Schaal\", \"sequence\": \"first\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Computer Science &amp; Neuroscience, University of Southern California, 3641 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089\\u20132520, USA\"}, {\"name\": \"ATR Human Information Sciences, 2\\u20132 Hikaridai, Seika\\u2013cho, Soraku\\u2013gun, Kyoto 619\\u20130218, Japan\"}]}, {\"given\": \"Auke\", \"family\": \"Ijspeert\", \"sequence\": \"additional\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Computer Science &amp; Neuroscience, University of Southern California, 3641 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089\\u20132520, USA\"}, {\"name\": \"School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Lausanne, CH 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland\"}]}, {\"given\": \"Aude\", \"family\": \"Billard\", \"sequence\": \"additional\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Computer Science &amp; Neuroscience, University of Southern California, 3641 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089\\u20132520, USA\"}, {\"name\": \"School of Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, CH 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland\"}]}], \"member\": \"175\", \"published-online\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003, 2, 17]]}, \"reference\": [{\"key\": \"p_1\", \"first-page\": \"331\", \"article-title\": \"Tasklevel robot learing: juggling a tennis ball more accurately.

From numerous behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to operational space control, this paper focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also some new variants of operational space controllers. We address formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels. First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm with several benchmark tasks. As an aside, we also introduce a novel parameter estimation algorithm for rigid body dynamics, which ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that one of the simplified acceleration-based approaches can be advantageous in terms of task performance, ease of parameter tuning, and general robustness and compliance in the face of inevitable modeling errors. </jats:p>\", \"DOI\": \"10.1177/0278364908091463\", \"type\": \"journal-article\", \"created\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008, 6, 5]], \"date-time\": \"2008-06-05T08:53:37Z\", \"timestamp\": 1212656017000}, \"page\": \"737-757\", \"source\": \"Crossref\", \"is-referenced-by-count\": 282, \"title\": [\"Operational Space Control: A Theoretical and Empirical Comparison\"], \"prefix\": \"10.1177\", \"volume\": \"27\", \"author\": [{\"given\": \"Jun\", \"family\": \"Nakanishi\", \"sequence\": \"first\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ICORP, Computational Brain Project, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama 332-0012, Japan, ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Department of Humanoid Robotics and Computational Neuroscience, Kyoto 619-0288, Japan,\"}]}, {\"given\": \"Rick\", \"family\": \"Cory\", \"sequence\": \"additional\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA,\"}]}, {\"given\": \"Michael\", \"family\": \"Mistry\", \"sequence\": \"additional\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Computer Science & Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520, USA,\"}]}, {\"given\": \"Jan\", \"family\": \"Peters\", \"sequence\": \"additional\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Computer Science & Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520, USA,\"}]}, {\"given\": \"Stefan\", \"family\": \"Schaal\", \"sequence\": \"additional\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Department of Humanoid Robotics and Computational Neuroscience, Kyoto 619-0288, Japan, Computer Science & Neuroscience, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520, USA,\"}]}], \"member\": \"179\", \"published-online\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008, 6, 1]]}, \"reference\": [{\"key\": \"atypb1\", \"volume-title\": \"Issues in repeatability of redundant manipulator control.

       " 'desc': 'ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network) is a 3-layer back-propagation network designed for the task of road following. Currently ALVINN takes images from a camera and a laser range finder as input and produces as output the direction the vehicle should travel in order to follow the road. Training has been conducted using simulated road images. Successful tests on the Carnegie Mellon autonomous navigation test vehicle indicate that the network can effectively follow real roads under certain field conditions. The representation developed to perform the task differs dramatically when the network is trained under various conditions, suggesting the possibility of a novel adaptive autonomous navigation system capable of tailoring its processing to the conditions at hand.

This leads to poor performance\\nin theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger\\nguarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train\\neither non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of\\niterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a\\nstationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in\\nan online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined\\nwith additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance\\nunder the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings.\\nWe demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two\\nchallenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling\\nproblem.', comment='Appearing in the 14th International Conference on Artificial\\n  Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2011)', journal_ref=None, doi=None, primary_category='cs.LG', categories=['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML'], links=[arxiv.Result.Link('http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0686v3', title=None, rel='alternate', content_type=None), arxiv.Result.Link('http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.0686v3', title='pdf', rel='related', content_type=None)])"
