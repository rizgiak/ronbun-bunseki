The proposed grasper has two important qualities: versatility and less complexity. The former refers to the ability to grasp a range of objects having different geometrical shape, size, and payload and perform in-hand manipulations such as rolling and sliding, and the latter refers to the uncomplicated design, and ease of planning and control strategies. Increasing the number of functions performed by the grasper to adapt to a variety of tasks in structured and unstructured environments without increasing the mechanical complexity is the main interest of this research. The proposed grasper consists of two hybrid jaws having a rigid inner structure encompassed by a flexible, active gripping surface. The flexibility of the active surface has been exploited to achieve shape conformation, and the same has been utilized with a compact mechanism, introduced in the jaws, to vary the contact forces while grasping and manipulating an object. Simple and scalable structure, compactness, low cost, and simple control scheme are the main features of the proposed design. Detailed kinematic and static analysis are presented to show the capability of the grasper to adjust and estimate the contact forces without using a force sensor. Experiments are conducted on the fabricated prototype to validate the different modes of operation and to evaluate the advantages of the proposed concept.",

Previously, phenomenological\nmethod has achieved success in describing experimental observation. However, it\ncannot directly bridge the laser threshold with molecular electronic structure\nparameters and cavity parameters. Quantum dynamics method for describing\norganic lasing and obtaining laser threshold is highly expected. In this\nLetter, we first propose a microscopic model suitable for describing the lasing\ndynamics of organic molecular system and we apply the time-dependent\nwave-packet diffusion (TDWPD) to reveal the microscopic quantum dynamical\nprocess for the optical pumped lasing behavior. Lasing threshold is obtained\nfrom the onset of output as a function of optical input pumping. We predict\nthat the lasing threshold has an optimal value as function of the cavity volume\nand depends linearly on the intracavity photon leakage rate. The\nstructure-property relationships between molecular electronic structure\nparameters (including the energy of molecular excited state, the transition\ndipole and the organization energy) and the laser threshold obtained through\nnumerical calculations are in qualitative agreement the experimental results,\nwhich also confirms the reliability of our approach. This work is beneficial to\nunderstanding the mechanism of organic laser and optimizing the design of\norganic laser materials. TOC",
