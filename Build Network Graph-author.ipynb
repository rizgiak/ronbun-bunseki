       "abstract": "We present a quantum dynamic study on organic lasing phenomena, which is a challenging issue in organic optoelectronics. Previously, phenomenological method has achieved success in describing experimental observation. However, it cannot directly bridge the laser threshold with molecular electronic structure parameters and cavity parameters. Quantum dynamics method for describing organic lasing and obtaining laser threshold is highly expected. In this Letter, we first propose a microscopic model suitable for describing the lasing dynamics of organic molecular system and we apply the time-dependent wave-packet diffusion (TDWPD) to reveal the microscopic quantum dynamical process for the optical pumped lasing behavior. Lasing threshold is obtained from the onset of output as a function of optical input pumping. We predict that the lasing threshold has an optimal value as function of the cavity volume and depends linearly on the intracavity photon leakage rate. The structure-property relationships between molecular electronic structure parameters (including the energy of molecular excited state, the transition dipole and the organization energy) and the laser threshold obtained through numerical calculations are in qualitative agreement the experimental results, which also confirms the reliability of our approach. This work is beneficial to understanding the mechanism of organic laser and optimizing the design of organic laser materials. TOC",
